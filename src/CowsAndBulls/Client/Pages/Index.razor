<h1>The Game of Cows and Bulls</h1>

<p>
    This is simulation of a pen and paper game that can be played between two players.
    One player thinks of a 4-digit number having all different digits.
    The other player has to guess that, based on the clues &ndash; the number of <i>cows</i> and <i>bulls</i>.
    A digit is a <i>Cow</i> when it is present but not at its correct position,
    and a <i>Bull</i> when it is present at its correct position also (remember <i>Bulls Eye</i>).
    Here, the two players are you and the computer!
</p>
<p>
    Suppose a player thinks of 1729 as the 4-digit number then the playing trail can possibly go as follows:
